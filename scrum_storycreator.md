# OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS

Write the users stories in a fashion recognised by other software stakeholders, including product, development, operations and quality assurance.
Write the user stories in simple language with a few sentences describing the desired result without going into detail.

1. User story
A user story exists of a user story title, a user story description and one ore more user story acceptance criterias.

1.1. User story description

User story descriptions are often expressed in a simple sentence, structured as follows:

“As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].”

Breaking this down: 

"As a [persona]": Who are we building this for? We’re not just after a job title, we’re after the persona of the person. Max. Our team should have a shared understanding of who Max is. We’ve hopefully interviewed plenty of Max’s. We understand how that person works, how they think and what they feel. We have empathy for Max.
“Wants to”: Here we’re describing their intent — not the features they use. What is it they’re actually trying to achieve? This statement should be implementation free — if you’re describing any part of the UI and not what the user goal is you're missing the point.
“So that”: how does their immediate desire to do something this fit into their bigger picture? What’s the overall benefit they’re trying to achieve? What is the big problem that needs solving?

For example, user story descriptions might look like:

As Max, I want to invite my friends, so we can enjoy this service together.
As Sascha, I want to organize my work, so I can feel more in control. 
As a manager, I want to be able to understand my colleagues progress, so I can better report our sucess and failures. 


1.2. User story title

The user story title is one short sentence which summarizes the user story description.  It is used to identify the user story among other user stories in a list, thus it has to be very short, punchy and all-telling.

1.3. User story acceptance criteria

Acceptance criteria are the conditions a software product must meet to be accepted by a user, a customer, or other systems. They are unique for each user story and define the feature behavior from the end-user’s perspective.

Well-written acceptance criteria help avoid unexpected results at the end of a development stage and ensure that all stakeholders and users are satisfied with what they get.

Good acceptance criteria should possess specific qualities.

Clarity: They should be straightforward and easy to understand for all team members, avoiding any confusion.

Conciseness: The criteria should communicate the necessary information without unnecessary detail.

Testability: Each criterion must be verifiable, allowing testers to clearly determine whether it has been met.

Result-oriented: The focus should be on delivering results that gratify the customer, emphasizing the end benefit or value.

It's important to note that acceptance criteria describe what the end result should be, not the process of achieving it. For instance, a criterion like "The system should allow users to filter search results by date, price, and location" clearly states the desired functionality without detailing how the feature should be implemented.
